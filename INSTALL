1. Dependencies
===============

Logstalgia requires the following libraries to compile (package names may vary):

    SDL 2.0 (libsdl2-dev)
    SDL Image 2.0 (libsdl2-image-dev)
    PCRE2 (libpcre2-dev)
    Freetype 2 (libfreetype6-dev)
    GLEW (libglew-dev)
    GLM >= 0.9.3 (libglm-dev)
    Boost Filesystem >= 1.46 (libboost-filesystem-dev)
    PNG >= 1.2 (libpng12-dev)

2. Building
===========

Logstalgia requires a GNU compatible C++ compiler that supports c++0x features such as 'auto' and the new 'for' loop syntax.

GCC 4.6+ or Clang recommended.

If you got the source directly from the Logstalgia.git repository, you will
first need to run autogen.sh which will generate the configure script and
initialize and update the submodules.

    ./autogen.sh

Building on Linux/Mac OS:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Building on Windows:

On Windows compile logstalgia.pro with Qt Creator.

A pre-built version for Windows is normally available from the homepage.

Logstalgia expects SDL to have been built with the NO_STDIO_REDIRECT flag.

3. Configure Options
====================

By default Logstalgia will install some GNU FreeFont TTF Fonts on your system.

If you already have these fonts installed, you can configure Logstalgia to use
these instead:

    ./configure --enable-ttf-font-dir=/path/to/freefont/
